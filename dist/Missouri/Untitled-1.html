<p>I pledge to take action to break the school to prison pipeline in Missouri.</p>

<p>I will read my school's discipline policy and flag concerns I have for the district regarding vague or discriminatory language, I will <a href="https://action.aclu.org/webform/mo-request-speaker">request a KYR workshop</a> from the ACLU to learn more about what my community can do to ensure equitable discipline, and I will speak out at my local school board to let my community know how this issue effects our students.</p>

<p>Justice doesn’t stop at the schoolhouse door. Missouri’s schools can do better.</p>
