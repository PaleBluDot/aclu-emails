CBP Can't Detain Domestic Flight Passengers for Refusing Suspicionless ID Checks

In 2017, Customs and Border Protection officers subjected passengers coming off a domestic Delta flight to an illegal ID check. We sued, and this week we announced a settlement in the case. CBP will now be responsible for issuing a nationwide directive clarifying that participation in such searches is voluntary. Agents will also be required to communicate as much to passengers deplaning in the future. This settlement is a forceful reminder that, despite the administration's claims, CBP's authority is limited -- by statute and by the Constitution. We'll continue to make sure CBP stays within those limits.

How to Stop Your City from Spying On You

Surveillance technology is slowly encroaching on every part of our lives. With regulation at the federal level slow to materialize, local governments are taking action. Two American cities -- San Francisco, Calif. and Somerville, Mass. -- recently passed local laws to ban the use of facial recognition technology by police and other government agencies. Is local advocacy our best bet for keeping the surveillance state at bay? Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, discusses a growing local movement to protect privacy.

A NEW THREAT TO IMMIGRANT FAMILIES
------------------------------------------------

The Trump Administration's Proposed 'Mixed Status' Housing Rule Is Another Form of Family Separation

A rule proposed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development could result in the eviction of tens of thousands of immigrant families from their homes. The rule would ban families comprising both of members who are eligible and ineligible for federal housing assistance from living in public and Section 8 housing. This policy would force families of "mixed status" to choose between separating and staying together. This week, we submitted comments urging HUD to withdraw the proposed rule.

I Spent 16 Months in Solitary Confinement and Now I'm Fighting to End It

When Kiana Calloway was 17 years old, he was imprisoned in Louisiana for a crime he did not commit. The 16 months he spent in solitary confinement still haunt him, even eight years after leaving prison. A report released last month that shares the stories of other people who spent time in solitary confinement in Louisiana -- "the solitary confinement capital of the world" -- reminds Kiana of his own experience. He calls for urgent reform to reduce the state's extreme dependence on prolonged isolation and move quickly toward safer and more humane alternatives.

DEFENDING THE RIGHT TO VOTE

Why the ACLU Is Suing Florida for Its New Poll Tax

Last November, nearly 65 percent of Florida voters -- more than 5 million people -- resoundingly approved Amendment 4, restoring voting rights to over a million of their fellow citizens, people who have served sentences for felony convictions. Florida politicians are now trying to destroy this progress. An unconstitutional law signed by the governor requires people who are eligible to vote under Amendment 4 to pay the exorbitant court costs, fines, and fees levied against them at the time of their conviction, or lose their right to vote. The ACLU and partners have filed a federal challenge seeking to block the law.

Bogus 'Aggression Detectors' Are Audio-Recording People in Public

Recent reports show that so-called "aggression detectors" -- which listen to people and sound alerts when human voices supposedly express "aggression" -- are being installed in hundreds of schools, hospitals, and other public places. This surveillance technology is bogus, an invasion of privacy, and a major threat to our liberty. We should all oppose it.
