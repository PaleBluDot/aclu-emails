Tomorrow is Giving Tuesday, when people raise awareness for the causes they believe in most.

At the ACLU, this year's campaign is especially critical: The Trump administration's racist, backward-looking agenda has had deep ramifications for our civil liberties, our communities, and our democracy. That's why we've set a particularly ambitious goal: raising $250,000 by midnight Tuesday.

Though the campaign kicks off tomorrow, there's no need to wait to make an impact.

As we litigate cases across the country, your support is helping real people, right now.

Thanks to your past leadership, we've demanded justice for immigrants, blocked efforts to suppress the vote, protected LGBTQ rights, ensured abortion access for all, and fought to undo the severe damage done by the Trump administration's cruel, anti-liberties agenda.

But we still have an incredible amount of work to do. It is your personal generosity that will push these efforts forward – together, we make a powerful team.

That's why I'm urging you to make your most generous, tax-deductible contribution to help the ACLU meet our $250,000 Giving Tuesday goal today.(https://action.aclu.org/give/giving-tuesday-goal-250000?cid=7014A000001ZrRzQAK&initms_aff=nat&initms_chan=eml&utm_medium=eml&initms=191202_givingtuesday_send2_mid_sel&utm_source=sel&utm_campaign=givingtuesday&utm_content=191202_send2_mid&af=##sb_query_string_encrypted##&gs=##direct_mail_appeal_string_encrypted##&ms_aff=nat&ms_chan=eml&ms=191202_givingtuesday_send2_mid_sel)

With your immediate support, we can continue fighting to defend our rights, freedoms and liberties.

Thank you,
