An initiative by Israel’s Government Companies Authority has created a connection between Israeli hospitals, defense companies, research institutions, and the Ministry of Health. The medical team puts forward the requirements, the companies and institutions produce solutions, and the regulator acts as integrator and gives approval in principle that allows technological solutions to be implemented in record time. As an example of this collaboration, the article cites a system for remotely measuring body temperature, and respiration and pulse rates, that is being trialed at a government hospital. Israel Aircraft Industries engineers combined an Elta radar system with optic and artificial intelligence technology from the Technion and Mafat. The system, which can remotely identify people suffering from fever, for example, could replace manual examinations not only at entrances to hospitals, but also at shopping centers, government offices, and more.

<div class="article-section">

<img class="article-img" src="https://ats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/group-standing-hall.jpg" alt="Group standing at the hallway." /><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Researchers at Technion and Rambam Health Care Campus have successfully tested a method that will dramatically increase the current COVID-19 testing capacity using existing available resources. This method, known as pooling, enables simultaneous testing of dozens of samples. Its implementation has the potential to greatly accelerate the rate of testing and detection of COVID-19 infected patients in the population. The trial was completed in a matter of days thanks to the support of the Ministry of Health and the close collaboration between Technion and Rambam. Testing for COVID-19 is currently being conducted with the focus on people with specific symptoms. The current rate of testing does not allow for monitoring of asymptomatic carriers in the population, which is vital to curb the epidemic.

<img class="article-img" src="https://ats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/operating-room.png" alt="Image of operating room." /><strong>Why this matters:</strong> In Israel and around the globe, tech companies, especially those in the medtech and biotech sectors, are being enlisted in the battle against COVID-19. This overview of Israeli companies allocating resources and manpower to find new solutions that could ease the strain on the overburdened healthcare system includes predictive care startup CLEW Medical. The company developed an algorithm that collects data from emergency care monitoring devices and alerts the medical team to any deterioration in a patient's condition. As the healthcare system becomes more and more burdened, Clew's technology could point out a patient in danger 6-12 hours before their condition starts to worsen, enabling caregivers to prepare in advance. CLEW Medical Founder Avigdor Faians is a Technion alumnus.

</div>
<div class="article-section">

<img class="article-img" src="https://ats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/virus.jpg" alt="Image of viruses." /><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Technion alumna Dr. Kira Radinsky and her team at Diagnostic Robotics have developed new technology to aid in the identification of Israeli patients who are developing COVID-19 symptoms, and helping to get those patients ready for home hospitalization. "The information is delivered as red flags to health services in Israel," said Radinsky, whose heat map of COVID-19 hot spots helps medical services identify which areas of the country need intensive care. Dr. Radinsky is Chair and Chief Technology Officer of Diagnostic Robotics.

<h3>Israel to Weigh "Compassionate Use" of Pluristem Therapy for COVID-19</h3>
<h5>Reuters, 3/19/20</h5>
</div>
<div class="article-section">

<img class="article-img" src="https://ats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/therapeutics.png" alt="Pluristem lab." /><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Israel's Health Ministry has approved a request by Pluristem Therapeutics to seek case-by-case permission for compassionate treatment of COVID-19 patients with its stem cell therapy. Pluristem said in a regulatory filing the ministry may now approve proposed treatments for severely ill patients, though it has yet to submit any requests and there is no guarantee the government would approve each case. Pluristem founder Dr. Shai Meretzki is a Technion alumnus.

<h3>Complacency, Not Panic, is the Real Danger</h3>

<div class="article-section">

<img class="article-img" src="https://ats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/erev-stairs.jpg" alt="Professor Ido Erev." /><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Despite mixed messages from government officials and shortages of tests and hospital capacity, there is little evidence of widespread panic during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, according to Professor Ido Erev of the Technion's William Davidson Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, decision-making under threat suggests that concerns about looming mass panic are badly misplaced.

<h3>Pooling Method for Accelerated Testing of COVID-19</h3>

<div class="article-section">

<img class="article-img" src="https://ats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/group-standing-hall.jpg" alt="Group staning in hallway." /><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Researchers at Technion and Rambam Health Care Campus have successfully tested a method that will dramatically increase the current COVID-19 testing capacity using existing available resources. This method, known as pooling, enables simultaneous testing of dozens of samples. Its implementation has the potential to greatly accelerate the rate of testing and detection of COVID-19 infected patients in the population. The trial was completed in a matter of days thanks to the support of the Ministry of Health and the close collaboration between Technion and Rambam. Testing for COVID-19 is currently being conducted with the focus on people with specific symptoms. The current rate of testing does not allow for monitoring of asymptomatic carriers in the population, which is vital to curb the epidemic.

<h3>Coronavirus Facility Opens at Rambam Hospital Using New Israeli Tech</h3>

<div class="article-section">

<img class="article-img" src="https://ats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/hospital.png" alt="Hospital." /><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Technion-affiliated Rambam Hospital is opening a new coronavirus department this week. The facility will be on its own floor, isolated from the rest of the hospital. Construction and logistic teams worked cut an entire floor of the hospital in two: a hospitalization wing on one side and rooms for the team on the other side. The department will also have a separate ambulance entrance and elevator. Air from the rooms will be pumped through a filter before it exits the building. The department will use a new remote monitoring system developed by the Israeli start-up BioBeat, whose co-founder and CTO Johanan May is a Technion alumnus. The system includes smart monitoring stickers that will replace currently used monitoring methods. The stickers will be put on all the patients and allow continuous monitoring of breathing, saturation, pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, and other essential metrics. The results will be continually streamed to an information system, allowing the monitoring of every patient without physical contact.

<img class="article-img" src="https://ats.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/group.png" alt="Group holding flags." /><strong>Why this matters:</strong> One of the most problematic elements of the current global coronavirus epidemic is that people appear to be contagious even before they show symptoms of the disease. Israeli company MeMed Diagnostics hopes to change that. The company is working with collaborators around the globe to see whether "some derivatives of MeMed technology" could detect infectious patients in the pre-symptomatic stage. According to MeMed Co-founder and CEO Eran Eden, who is a Technion alumnus, the company already has preliminary data showing that "one could potentially monitor the immune response and tell if somebody will be sick before he feels sick."

<h4>Could a Vaccine for Shrimp Help in the Fight Against COVID-19?: A Conversation with Professor Avi Schroeder</h4>

Stopping the production of those proteins will effectively stop the virus, says Technion Professor Avi Schroeder in this Live from Technion webinar. Prof. Schroeder shared how synthesizing a molecule called siRNA, and using it to replace naturally occurring RNA molecules, has proven effective in stopping the highly destructive white spot virus from passing from one cell to another in shrimp. And how it could be possible to apply the same technology to help in the fight against COVID-19. Professor Avi Schroeder is an associate professor and a member of the Wolfson Faculty of Chemical Engineering at the Technion.
